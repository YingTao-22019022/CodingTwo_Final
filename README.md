In this project, I created a computer art installation that allows an infinite number of particles to fall randomly and collide with 12 piano keys in the scene to create a unique sound. The project's purpose is to explore the intersection of computer-generated randomness and music creation.

To accomplish this, I used the openFrameworks library to leverage powerful tools such as the "ofSoundPlayer.h" and "ofxBox2d.h" libraries. These libraries enabled me to synthesize realistic piano sounds and simulate the physics of particle movement and collisions.

The particles in the installation fall from the top of the screen and bounce off the piano keys, producing notes that blend together in a random and constantly evolving composition. To achieve this, I used object-oriented programming techniques such as class inheritance and polymorphism to create a flexible and modular particle system that could interact with the piano in a dynamic way.

The result is a dynamic and captivating installation that generates a unique soundscape with every run. The collision between the particles and piano creates an unpredictable yet harmonious blend of sounds that can be both mesmerizing and unpredictable. The installation highlights the potential of computers as a tool for creative expression and shows how seemingly random elements can combine to create something beautiful and meaningful.

Overall, this project is a testament to the power of technology and its potential to push the boundaries of what we consider art. By blending computer-generated randomness with music, I was able to create a truly unique and inspiring work that invites the viewer to consider the intersection of art and technology.
